The Signleton Pattern
This is an example of a Creational Design Pattern.

When to use:
- it is important to only have one instance of a class 
  e.g., one window manager, one file system, one print
  spooler, etc.
- to centralize management of resources
- to provide a global point of access to the object.
- to ensure read/writes are synchronized in a multithreaded environment

Examples:
- Logger Classes
- Database Connection Classes
- Configuration Classes
- Factories
